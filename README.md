To work with this system each user will have its unique user id and password through which they access this system. To manage and integrate various modules and to eliminate the concept of data redundancy each module will have data sharing property with other modules as and when required. For each module, there will be unique for each of their members such as family details of a students, student records, staff member’s details etc.





Old System:
Under the existing system there was no any medium to make direct communication between parents and administration. To inform about status and study reports to parents of a student, administration must write letter to make them inform. Students must check their notice board to get information about details about their routine, exam time tables, about their results and marks scored exam subject wise. Working employees and staff members must visit their bank to check their payment confirmation monthly.

Through this new system, all working employees will able to check their payment status and total number of working days or we can say their attendance and deduction made from their salary and for what purpose. Students will able to check their results, time tables and routines by going through their student dashboard. Administration will able to send direct messages to the parent’s inbox by using their id and parents will check those messages and apply directly to them.
